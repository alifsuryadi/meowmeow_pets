## Game Mechanics

### Pet Stats

- **Energy**: Decreases with activities, restored through sleep
- **Happiness**: Increased by playing, decreased by work and sleep
- **Hunger**: Decreased by activities, restored by feeding

### Activities

#### Individual Actions
- **Feed**: Costs 5 coins, restores 20 hunger, gains 5 experience
- **Play**: Costs 15 energy and hunger, gains 25 happiness and 10 experience
- **Work**: Costs 20 energy, happiness, and hunger, gains 15 coins and 15 experience
- **Sleep**: Restores energy over time, gradually decreases happiness and hunger

#### PTB Combo Actions
- **Eat ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Sleep**: Combines feeding, working, and sleeping in one transaction
- **Wake ‚Üí Eat ‚Üí Work**: Wakes pet (if sleeping), feeds (if needed), then works

These combo actions provide gas efficiency and streamlined gameplay experience.

## PTB (Programmable Transaction Block) Features

The latest version introduces powerful combo actions using Sui's PTB capabilities:

### Smart Combo Logic
- **Conditional Execution**: Actions only execute if conditions are met
- **Resource Optimization**: Single transaction reduces gas costs
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation prevents failed transactions

### Available Combos
1. **Eat ‚Üí Work ‚Üí Sleep Combo**
   - Prerequisites: Pet must be awake, have coins to feed, and meet work requirements
   - Flow: Feed pet ‚Üí Work for coins ‚Üí Put pet to sleep
   - Benefits: Maximizes pet productivity in one action

2. **Wake ‚Üí Eat ‚Üí Work Combo**  
   - Prerequisites: Pet can be sleeping or awake, must meet work conditions
   - Flow: Wake pet (if sleeping) ‚Üí Feed (if needed) ‚Üí Work for coins
   - Benefits: Gets sleeping pets back to productive state quickly

### Technical Implementation
- Smart contract validates all conditions before execution
- UI shows combo buttons only when all prerequisites are met
- Atomic transactions ensure all-or-nothing execution

### Leveling System

- Pets start at level 1
- Require 100 experience per level to advance
- Appearance changes at levels 2 and 3
- Experience is consumed when leveling up
